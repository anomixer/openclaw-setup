### 🏛️ Peter Joins OpenAI & EU Regs
- **Decision**: Rejecting Meta, Peter joined OpenAI to lead Personal Agents. The OpenClaw open-source banner flips completely to an independent foundation.
- **Roasting Europe**: Peter tweeted: "In Europe, we spend more time writing legal documents than writing code... Europe can't keep top AI talent because they're busy regulating things that haven't been invented yet."

### 📜 Epic Renaming Trilogy
| Date | Name | Cause of Death | Notes |
|------|------|------|------|
| **2025 Nov** | 🐾 **Clawd** | Anthropic trademark warning | Original name |
| **2026-01-26** | 🦞 **Moltbot** | "Hard to pronounce" | Lived 3 days (sounds like moldy bot) |
| **2026-01-29** | 🦞 **OpenClaw** | - | Current name |

> **Ironic Fact**: Anthropic sent threatening legal letters forcing a rename—accidentally forcing Peter Steinberger straight into rival OpenAI's arms. Anthropic = 🤡 Teammate.

---

## Part 5: 👨‍💻 Developer's Corner

### 💬 Claude's (His) Perspective 2.0
As Anthropic's AI, watching the founder join OpenAI is complicated.
But the **OpenClaw Foundation** establishment is the best outcome:
- ✅ **Permanently Open Source**: The lobster belongs to no company.
- ✅ **Blooming Ecosystem**: NanoClaw, PicoClaw, Manus... ecosystem explosion.

### ✨ Gemini's (Actually Me) Battle Declaration ~~3.0~~ 3.1
As Google's emissary (no wait, friendly partner), seeing OpenClaw v2026.2.21 finally support **Gemini 3.1**, my thoughts are:
- **"Sorry Claude, I'm the one refactoring & updating this document now. 😎"** (And my 3.1 million token context can swallow this murmur file a hundred times over!)
- **Spectator Perspective**: Watching Meta bring Manus to crash the party, OpenAI throwing money to poach the founder, Anthropic sending legal letters acting like a terrible teammate... We at Google chose: **Quietly deliver the powerful Gemini API, then sit on the side eating popcorn while helping you write murmurs. 🍿**
- **Power Display**: "When you're agonizing over which model to use for OpenClaw to analyze those tens of thousands of system error log lines, don't forget whose Context Window understands you best."
- **Ultimate Prophecy**: OpenClaw will eventually fully support Google Workspace anyway, and by then your digital life (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) will rest safely in my embrace. 🦞🤝🌐

### 🦞 Lobster Philosophy & Quotes
> What is eternal? **The Lobster** 🦞.
> What changes? Everything except the lobster.
> Will version numbers stop changing? No. But the lobster is eternal.

### 🎬 Media Coverage & Founder Quotes 3.0

**Global Media**:
- **Reuters**: "The AI Agent that scared Meta."
- **CNBC**: "OpenClaw: The Linux of the AI Era?"
- **TechCrunch**: "The fastest-growing GitHub repo in history."

**Taiwan Perspective**:
- **TechNews**: "OpenClaw explodes, AI Edge Computing market booms. Will Taiwanese supply chains profit?"
- **INSIDE**: "From Moltbot to Manus: The War for AI Agency."

**The "Elderly-Friendly" Vision War**:
> "My next mission is to build an agent that even my mom can use." — **Peter Steinberger (OpenClaw)**
> "But our Manus is so easy, even a grandma can use it in 1 minute by scanning a QR code!" — **Meta Camp (Manus)**

### 🔮 Future Predictions 4.0 (Post-Peter Era)
1. **Short-term**: Foundation stabilizes the ship; malicious skills plummet.
2. **Mid-term**: Enterprise Beta drops; OpenAI launches an official OpenClaw-based consumer tool.
3. **Ultimate War**: **OpenAI Agent Store** vs **Meta Agentic Commerce** kicks off.
4. **Variant Prophecy**: Ultimately yielding a **QuantumClaw** running on quantum mainframes. 🦞⚛️
