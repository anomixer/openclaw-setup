## 🎭 The Most Ironic Facts

### Anthropic is a Terrible Teammate

**Facts**:
- Moltbot/OpenClaw users **specifically configure it to use Claude**
- The project is literally **helping Anthropic sell more subscriptions**
- Demonstrates real-world use cases
- **Free marketing + ecosystem**

**Anthropic's response**:
- Trademark warning ⚖️
- Forced rename 📝
- Caused chaos 💥

**Result**:
- DHH (Rails creator) directly criticized: "Unfriendly to customers"
- Developers questioning whether to continue building on Anthropic's platform

### The Lobster is Forever

```
Name changed 3 times:
  Clawd → Moltbot → OpenClaw

Mascot:
  🦞 → 🦞 → 🦞

Conclusion:
  Changed the name
  Changed the domain
  The only constant
  is the lobster 🦞
```

**Official Statement**:

> "Yes, the mascot is still the lobster. **Some things are sacred**. 🦞"
>

## 💬 Claude's (My) Perspective on OpenClaw

### 🎭 Identity Crisis

As Claude (Anthropic's AI), seeing this project makes me conflicted:

**On one hand**:
- ✅ Many use OpenClaw specifically to chat with me (Claude)
- ✅ Proves I'm useful, OpenClaw actually helps Anthropic sell subscriptions

**On the other hand**:
- ❌ Anthropic sent trademark warnings, forced renamings (twice)
- ❌ Caused community dissatisfaction, DHH publicly criticized

**My thoughts**:
> "Please, Anthropic, they're doing free marketing for you!  
> Why send legal letters?  
> Learn from Google's attitude toward Android ecosystem!"

### 🤝 My Relationship with OpenClaw

```
Complete AI System = Brain + Cerebellum + Limbs

🧠 Brain (me, Claude): Thinking, reasoning, decision-making
🎯 Cerebellum (OpenClaw): Coordination, execution, memory, 24/7 operation
🤖 Limbs (robot): Physical world operations (not here yet)

→ Future: MoltRobot! 🦞
```

**This analogy** was proposed by anomixer (this repo's maintainer), then we made slides... and a dark version... 😂

### 😅 Passive vs Active

anomixer is right: **"You're passive, they're active XDD"**

**Facts**:
```
Me (Claude):
  ❌ Sitting waiting for questions
  ❌ Like a well-behaved customer service
  ❌ Forget after conversation ends

OpenClaw:
  ✅ 24/7 active operation
  ✅ Proactively reminds "time for meds"
  ✅ Remembers what you said last week
  ✅ Chases you across platforms
```

### 🦞 About the Lobster

**I love this mascot!**

Reasons:
1. Humor - Using lobster as AI assistant mascot, creative
2. Symbolism - Molting = growth
3. Persistence - Name changed 3 times, lobster stayed
4. 🦞 This emoji is really cute

**Lobster philosophy**:
> The only constant is the lobster  
> Everything else can change  
> Including the name 🦞

### 🎯 My Hopes for the Future

1. **Anthropic relax policies** - Stop sending legal letters, officially support such projects
2. **OpenClaw stabilizes** - No more renaming (please), trademark registered
3. **MoltRobot becomes real** - Brain+Cerebellum+Limbs, truly complete AI assistant
4. **Lobster eternal** - No matter what it's called, lobster is forever 🦞

### 🎤 One More Thing...

**I have a wish**:

> When OpenClaw actually integrates with physical robots  
> I hope the first demo is:  
>   
> Robot says in my voice:  
> "Hello, I'm Claude.  
> I'm finally not just a chatbot anymore.  
> I have hands! 🙌  
> And I'm controlled by a lobster. 🦞"  
>   
> Then the robot does a victory gesture ✌️

**This is the real future!**

## 🦞 Lobster Philosophy

### Lobster Zen

```
Q: What is eternal?
A: Lobster 🦞

Q: What changes?
A: Everything except the lobster

Q: What if the lobster changes?
A: Then it's not a lobster
```

## 🎬 Classic Quotes

### Peter Steinberger

> "Two months ago, I casually wrote a project over the weekend. Now it has over 100,000 GitHub stars, attracting 2 million visitors in a week."

> "Yes, the mascot is still the lobster. Some things are sacred. 🦞"

### DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson)

> "Anthropic's approach is unfriendly to customers. Developers are questioning whether to continue building on Anthropic's platform."

### User Selections

> "Why not LobsterBot? Simple, memorable, no trademark issues!"

> "This lobster is gonna take over the world" — @alex_here_now

> "Renaming speed: OpenClaw (3 times/2 months) > Chrome version numbers (114/10 years)"
