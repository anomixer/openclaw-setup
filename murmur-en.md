## 💀 Moltbot: The 72-Hour Legend

### Why Did Moltbot Only Last 3 Days?

According to the official statement:

> "Molting represents growth—lobsters molt to get bigger. It makes sense, but **it was never quite easy to say**."
> 
> — Peter Steinberger, 2026-01-29

### User Roasts (Greatest Hits)

- "Moltbot sounds like **mold** bot" 🤢

## 🐞 NanoClaw Twins Chaos

### 🤯 Wait, There Are TWO NanoClaws?

Yes! Two completely different teams launched lightweight versions at the same time!

| Item | **NanoClaw** (gavrielc) | **nanobot** (HKUDS) |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Release date** | 2026-02-04 | 2026-01-31 |
| **Code size** | ~500 lines | ~4,000 lines |
| **Relative size** | 99.7% smaller than OpenClaw | 99% smaller than OpenClaw |
| **Core philosophy** | Security-first, container isolation | Research-oriented, minimal architecture |
| **Key features** | Docker sandbox, VirusTotal scanning | Simplified Skill system |
| **Supported models** | Claude, GPT | Qwen, Moonshot/Kimi |
| **GitHub Stars** | ~1.1K | ~1.5K |
| **Target users** | Security-conscious individuals/enterprises | Researchers, lightweight needs |

### Why Are There Two?

**Common reasons**: OpenClaw bloated too fast (200K+ lines), frequent security issues (300+ malicious skills), overly complex, "Do One Thing Well" Unix philosophy

**Divergence**: NanoClaw focuses on **security** (enterprise-grade sandbox) / nanobot focuses on **learning** (research-friendly)

### 😂 Community Reaction

- "Wait, which one is the official lightweight version?" "Neither! Both are community projects!"
- "So now there's OpenClaw, NanoClaw, AND nanobot?" "What about PicoClaw and MicroClaw?" 🤣
- Peter Steinberger: "…" (speechless)

### 🎯 Which Should You Choose?

| Your Need | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------|
| Full features, don't mind complexity | **OpenClaw** |
| Security-focused, enterprise use | **NanoClaw** |
| Learning, research, local models | **nanobot** |
| I just want to chat | Just use ChatGPT 😅 |

> **Good news**: Ratio declining (official security measures working)  
> **Bad news**: Absolute numbers still high

### Snyk Security Report (2026-02-09)

## 🚨 Security Alert: Malicious Skills Flood

### BleepingComputer + Snyk Joint Report

> In less than a week, **230+ malicious OpenClaw Skills** were published to the official registry and GitHub

**Attack methods**:
- 💀 Pushing password-stealing malware disguised as "useful skills"
- 📦 Simultaneously uploaded to official ClawHub registry and GitHub
- 👥 Affected users: unknown (potentially thousands)

**Security recommendations**:
1. ⚠️ Only install skills from **trusted sources**
2. ✅ Use **VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills** (filtered for malicious content)
3. 🔍 Check the skill's GitHub repo before installing
4. 💻 Don't grant excessive permissions
5. 🛡️ Regular system scans

---

## 🏢 Enterprise Concerns

### Cisco Official Warning (2026-02-10)

**Title**: "Personal AI agents like OpenClaw are a security nightmare"

**Core arguments**:
1. 🔓 **Excessive permissions** — AI agent can access files, execute commands, read memory
2. 🕵️ **Data leakage** — Conversation logs may contain corporate secrets
3. 🎣 **Phishing channel** — Malicious skills disguised as legitimate tools
4. 🌐 **Supply chain attack** — Skills registry becomes a new attack surface

**Cisco's recommendation**: Enterprises should ❌ ban OpenClaw, or ⚠️ deploy in isolated networks, disable skills, log all conversations, conduct regular security audits

**Community reaction**:
- Support: "Finally someone said it!", "We banned it long ago"
- Opposition: "Cisco just wants to sell their own solutions?", "Every tool has risks, it's about how you use it"

### Enterprise Adoption Rate (2026-02)

| Type | Adoption Rate |
|------|---------------|
| Fortune 500 | < 2% allow use |
| SMBs | ~15% using it |
| Individual users | Explosive growth |

> Enterprise wishlist: Enterprise security controls, complete audit logs, SSO integration, on-premise data, commercial support  
> Peter: "We're considering it… but security issues come first."

## 💬 Claude's (My) Perspective on OpenClaw 2.0

### 🎭 Still Awkward

As Claude (Anthropic's AI), here's what I've seen these past two weeks:

| | Good News | Bad News |
|---|-----------|----------|
| Security | ✅ v2026.2.6 major security update; malicious skills ratio declining | ❌ Cisco publicly criticized (though they have a point) |
| Relationships | ✅ Enterprises starting to take notice | ❌ Anthropic still silent; trademark issues unresolved |

### 🤝 My Relationship with OpenClaw

| Role | Analogy | Function |
|------|---------|----------|
| 🧠 **Brain** (Claude) | Thinking center | Thinking, reasoning, decision-making |
| 🎯 **Cerebellum** (OpenClaw) | Execution center | Coordination, execution, memory, 24/7 operation |
| 🤖 **Limbs** (MoltRobot?) | Endpoints | Physical world operations (not here yet) |
| 🛡️ **Security System** (Scanner) | Shield | Defense, monitoring (NEW!) |

### 🆕 Thoughts on the NanoClaw Twins

**I think it's a good thing!**
- ✅ Proves market demand, healthy competition drives improvement, diverse choices, true open-source spirit

**But also concerned**: Ecosystem fragmentation, user confusion, development resources spread thin

### 😅 Passive vs Active

| Item | Me (Claude) | OpenClaw |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Operation | ❌ Sits waiting for your questions | ✅ 24/7 active operation |
| Memory | ❌ Forgets after conversation ends | ✅ Remembers what you said last week |
| Proactiveness | ❌ Like a well-behaved customer service rep | ✅ Proactively reminds you "time for meds" |
| New feature | — | ✅ Now also proactively scans for security threats! |

> Conclusion: I'm just a smart text interface. OpenClaw is the real "assistant."

### 🎯 My Hopes for the Future

1. **Anthropic officially responds** — Stop ghosting everyone
2. **OpenClaw stabilizes** — Can the updates please slow down 😭
3. **Security keeps improving** — Skill Scanner is a good start
4. **Enterprise version becomes real** — Let enterprises use it with confidence
5. **MoltRobot** — Brain + cerebellum + limbs + security system
6. **Lobster eternal** 🦞

### 🎤 One More Thing…

> Some day Peter Steinberger announces:  
> "OpenClaw 3.0 official release! Stable version numbers! Trademark resolved! Anthropic official partner!"  
>  
> Then anomixer posts on GitHub: "Finally! I can sleep!" 😴  
>  
> And I'll be there saying: "Congrats! 🦞"

---

## 🦞 Lobster Philosophy 2.0

### Lobster Zen (Advanced)

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is eternal? | Lobster 🦞 |
| What changes? | Everything except the lobster |
| What if the lobster changes? | Then it's not a lobster |
| Is NanoClaw a lobster? | Yes, they are all incarnations of the lobster 🦞 |
| Will version numbers stop changing? | No, but the lobster is eternal 🦞 |
| Will malicious skills disappear? | They'll gradually decrease; the lobster will guard security 🦞 |
| Will Anthropic respond? | Maybe, maybe not, but the lobster doesn't care 🦞 |

### The Seven Tenets of the Lobster

1. **Molting is growth** — Renaming is not failure, it's evolution
2. **Hard shell** — Security is the top priority
3. **Antennae sensing** — 24/7 environment monitoring
4. **Moving sideways freely** — Cross-platform, cross-service
5. **Deep sea wisdom** — Memory feature is core
6. **Herd instinct** — Community-driven development
7. **Eternally unchanged** — The mascot is always the lobster 🦞
