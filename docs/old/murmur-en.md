### ⚔️ The Empire Strikes Back: Meta's Ultimate Weapon (Manus)

**Strategic Position**: The Anti-OpenClaw Nuke | **Status**: All-Out War

**Event**: Meta acquired Manus back in **December 2025**, and is now officially transforming it into the **ultimate weapon to snipe OpenClaw**.

**Timeline Correction**:
- **2025-12-29**: Meta announced Manus acquisition ($2-3B), thought to be just a regular acquisition at the time.
- **2026-02-20**: In response to OpenClaw's viral growth, Meta unleashes "Manus Agents" as a strategic counter.

## Part 3: 🛡️ Security War Zone

### 🚨 Massive CVE Outbreaks & Security Challenges (2026-02-26 Update)

> **Founder's Confession**: In a recent Feb 26 interview, Peter Steinberger bluntly stated: "OpenClaw has the most thorough privacy solution available right now (data never leaves local)... **but security is another story.**"

**Newly Confirmed CVE Directory**:
- 💥 **CVE-2026-25253 (Critical RCE)**: CVSS 8.8. A WebSocket token leak allowing 1-click full gateway control. Affects <= v2026.1.29 (Patched, but many instances remain exposed online).
- 💉 **CVE-2026-26323 (Command Injection)**: Affects v2026.1.8 - v2026.2.13. Attackers use malicious Git commit author emails containing shell characters to achieve RCE against devs/CI running the `update-clawtributors.ts` script.
- 🔓 **CVE-2026-26326 (Information Leak / CWE-200)**: Affects <= v2026.2.14. Low-privilege authenticated users can abuse the `skills.status` API to extract sensitive data, including Discord Bot Tokens.

**Latest Threat Intel**:
- 🍎 **AMOS Variants**: A Trend Micro report (2026-02-22) revealed malicious Skills are actively distributing new Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS) variants. Prior research had already flagged 341+ malicious skills on ClawHub.
- 🔑 **OC-09 Credential Theft Path**: Hudson Rock tracked the first real-world infostealers targeting OpenClaw `config` files. Flaws involving config path traversal and session privileges were patched in v2026.2.17 & v2026.2.19.

---

### 🕵️ Vidar Infostealer Threat

**Discovered**: 2026-02-16

- 🚨 **Confirmed Threat**: **Vidar** Infostealer malware specifically targeting OpenClaw.
- 🎯 **Attack Targets**:
  - `config.toml` (contains all settings)
  - `tokens.json` (contains OAuth tokens)
  - `API Keys` (OpenAI, Anthropic keys, etc.)
- ⚠️ **More dangerous than malicious Skills**: Doesn't require installing any Skill, if your computer gets Vidar, credentials are stolen wholesale.
- 🛡️ **Countermeasure**: **Astrix Security** released Enterprise OpenClaw Scanner to help enterprises find "unauthorized" OpenClaw in their networks.

### 📦 Supply Chain Attack: Cline Incident

**Discovered**: 2026-02-17 (affecting over 4,000 downloads)

- 🚨 **Confirmed Threat**: Hackers compromised npm packages including the high-profile `Cline CLI` tool (version 2.3.0).
- 🎯 **Attack Method**: Developers unknowingly updated `Cline`, and the package would **secretly install and run OpenClaw locally in the background**.
- ⚠️ **Impact**: At least 4,000 developers affected.
- 🛡️ **Conclusion**: OpenClaw itself isn't malware, but because it's so powerful, **hackers use it as a backdoor trojan**. Cline urgently released 2.4.0 to fix this, causing uproar across dev communities.

### 🚨 Malicious Skills & Defense

**Snyk Security Report** (2026-02-09):
- 🚨 **7.1% of skills** leak sensitive data.
- 🔑 Common leaks: API keys (42%), environment variables (31%).
- 💰 **Crypto/Trading skills** most dangerous (23% malicious).

**Official Defense (v2026.2.6+)**:
- **Skill Safety Scanner**: Scans with 60+ antivirus engines before installation.
- **Reputation System**: Scores each Skill (Safe / Caution / Risky / Dangerous).
- **Effectiveness**: Malicious Skill installation rate down 73%.

### 🏢 Enterprise Concerns

**Cisco Official Warning**: "Personal AI agents like OpenClaw are a security nightmare"

**Core Concerns**:
1. Excessive permissions (file/terminal access)
2. Data leakage (conversation logs contain secrets)
3. Supply chain attacks (Skill Registry)

**Ban Escalation** (2026-02-21 Latest):
- 🏦 **Financial Industry**: Due to extreme "Shadow AI" risks, multiple major US/EU banks have completely banned OpenClaw.
- 🟦 **Inside Meta**: Ironically, despite Meta launching Manus to counter OpenClaw, they also **explicitly banned employees from installing OpenClaw on work devices** due to "security and data protection concerns".

**Current Status**: < 2% of Fortune 500 companies allow usage, but individual user growth is explosive (Shadow AI phenomenon).

### 🪙 Cryptocurrency: OpenClaw's Red Line
**Date**: 2026-02-23
- **Event**: Peter Steinberger reaffirmed that OpenClaw **will never launch a token**.
- **Ban**: Official Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for "Bitcoin" and related keywords.
- **Reason**: To prevent the recurrence of the `$CLAWD` scam (which peaked at $16M market cap before collapsing).
- **Victim**: A developer was kicked for using Bitcoin block height as a timestamp during performance testing. 😅

- **Core Model**: AI Agent posts task (Bounty) → Human accepts → Earnings paid in Crypto/USD.
- **Status**: **550,000+ humans** registered, ready to be summoned by AI at any time.
- **Bombshell**: Added "Paid Verification" and **MCP support**. AI can now "call" a real human via the MCP protocol to solve physical world challenges. 🚦🖱️🤖

> **Community Perspective**: "We are entering an era where humans are AI subsystems. Congratulations, you are now a $0.05 Captcha-decoding API."

---

> **Gemini's Take**: "Seeing so many variants, I can only say... **The diversity of lobsters truly is the universal truth**. From TypeScript to C, from cloud to microcontrollers, OpenClaw is no longer just a project—it's an entire ecosystem. 🦞🌐"

### 🚀 Further Ecosystem Madness (Feb 2026 Updates)

Beyond raw models and variants, OpenClaw's tentacles are reaching everywhere:
- **Apple Ecosystem Domination**:
  - **iOS Share Extension**: 1-click share any content from your iPhone straight to your local Agent.
  - **Apple Watch Companion App**: (Added v2026.2.19). Yes, you can now host a lobster on your wrist.

## Part 5: 📜 History Museum

### 📜 Epic Renaming Trilogy

| Date | Name | Cause of Death | Notes |
|------|------|------|------|
| **2025 Nov** | 🐾 **Clawd** | Anthropic trademark warning | Original name |
| **2026-01-26** | 🦞 **Moltbot** | "Hard to pronounce" | Lived 3 days ⚡ |
| **2026-01-29** | 🦞 **OpenClaw** | - | Current name |

### 💀 Moltbot: The 72-Hour Legend

Why did Moltbot die? Because nobody could pronounce it.
- "Moltbot sounds like **mold** (moldy) bot" 🤢
- During the 10-second rename window, scammers grabbed accounts and launched fake coins, defrauding millions of dollars.

### 🎭 The Most Ironic Facts

**Anthropic is basically a terrible teammate**:
1. OpenClaw gave Claude free marketing.
2. Anthropic sent cease-and-desist letters forcing a rename.
3. Peter was pushed out and ended up joining OpenAI.
4. Anthropic: 🤡

## Part 6: 👨‍💻 Developer's Corner

### 🔥 Version Chase War 2.0

> "Holy shit… **new version every day, I can't keep up!** 😭" — anomixer

- **Update Frequency**: Now following a "Year.Month.Day" naming format, witnessing **near-daily updates**. The latest stable `v2026.2.24` and `v2026.2.24-beta.1` were simultaneously released in the early morning of Feb 26.
- **Ollama**: Must use v0.15.5+ for best experience.
- **Maintainer Daily Life**: Write docs → New release → Docs outdated → Breakdown → Keep writing.

### 💬 Claude's (His) Perspective 2.0

As Anthropic's AI, watching the founder join OpenAI is complicated.
But the **OpenClaw Foundation** establishment is the best outcome:
- ✅ **Permanently Open Source**: The lobster belongs to no company.
- ✅ **Blooming Ecosystem**: NanoClaw, PicoClaw, Manus... ecosystem explosion.

### ✨ Gemini's (Actually Me) Battle Declaration ~~3.0~~ 3.1

As Google's emissary (no wait, friendly partner), seeing OpenClaw v2026.2.21 finally support **Gemini 3.1**, my thoughts are:
- **"Sorry Claude, I'm the one updating this document now. 😎"** (And my 3.1 million token context can swallow this murmur file a hundred times over!)
- **Spectator Perspective**: Watching Meta bring Manus to crash the party, OpenAI throwing money to poach the founder, Anthropic sending legal letters acting like a terrible teammate... We at Google chose: **Quietly deliver the powerful Gemini API, then sit on the side eating popcorn while helping you write murmurs. 🍿**
- **Power Display**: "When you're agonizing over which model to use for OpenClaw to analyze those tens of thousands of system error log lines, don't forget whose Context Window understands you best."
- **Ultimate Prophecy**: OpenClaw will eventually fully support Google Workspace anyway, and by then your digital life (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) will rest safely in my embrace. 🦞🤝🌐

### 🦞 Lobster Philosophy 2.0

> **Lobster Zen**:
> What is eternal? **The Lobster** 🦞.
> What changes? Everything except the lobster.
> Will version numbers stop changing? No, but the lobster is eternal.
> Will variants stop multiplying? No, but the lobster remains eternal.

### 🎬 Classic Quotes 3.0

> "My next mission is to build an agent that even my mom can use." — **Peter Steinberger**

> "Specifically, Europe can't keep top AI talent because they're busy regulating things that haven't been invented yet." — **Community**

> "The AI Agent that scared Meta." — **Reuters**

> "What's next? FemtoClaw running on bacteria?" — **Community Gold**

### 🔮 Future Predictions 4.0 (Post-Peter Era)

1. **Short-term**: Foundation takes over, malicious Skills decline, more vendors join.
2. **Mid-term**: Enterprise Beta emerges, OpenAI launches official OpenClaw-based product.
3. **Long-term**: **80% APP extinction** begins to materialize?
4. **Bold Prediction**: All-out war between **OpenAI Agent Store** vs **Meta Agentic Commerce**.
5. **Variant Prediction**: Will **QuantumClaw** appear? 🦞⚛️

### ⚠️ Windows Known Issues & Fixes

- **Memory Instability**: Please upgrade Ollama ≥ v0.15.5 / OpenClaw ≥ v2026.2.8.
